# Educational-FPS-Project
A Unity 3D Project being made to learn and practice FPS game development basics.
It is currently ongoing in development.
This is my first 3D project in Unity I created from scratch.
Currently the player's abilities are running, jumping, double-jumping, sprinting and shooting.
The enemy can follow the player avoiding other objects in the path, stops at a certain distance to the player, stops following the player if the player goes away too far (if this happens it goes to player's last known position, waits for a bit then returns to starting point) shoot the player if the player is at a certain angle (in time intervals) track the player while shooting at a certain angle (even if the player is midair). The enemy takes 3x damage upon headshot (instant kill at current settings).
The player health system works as intended. 
Respawn function is being worked on.
The gun model, the enemy model and enemy run, shoot and idle animations are made by kenney.nl.
