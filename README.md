# Educational-FPS-Project
A Unity 3D Project being made to learn and practice FPS game development basics.
It is currently ongoing in development.
This is my first 3D project in Unity I created from scratch.
Currently the player's abilities are running, jumping and shooting; the enemy can follow the player avoiding other objects in the path, stops at a certain distance to the player, stops following the player if the player goes away too far (if this happens it goes to player's last known position, waits for a bit then returns to starting point) shoot the player if the player is at a certain angle (in time intervals) track the player while shooting at a certain angle (even if the player is midair).
The gun model, the enemy model and enemy run, shoot and idle animations are made by kenney.nl.
